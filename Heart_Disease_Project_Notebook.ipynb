    "\n",
    "> Heart disease is a collection of diseases and conditions that cause cardiovascular problems. Normally, in this disease, the heart fails to supply a sufficient amount of blood to other parts of the body in order to accomplish their normal functionalities. This is simply heart conditions that include diseased vessels, structural problems and blood clots. Early and on-time diagnosing of this problem is very essential for preventing patients from more damage and saving their lives. \n",

    "## Why Probabilistic Machine Learning for Heart Disease Diagnosis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical uncertainty is considered as a natural feature for medicine and medical practice. Understanding medical uncertainty and acquiring proper coping strategies is regarded as a core clinical competency for medical specialists. Medical practice is properly known to be full of uncertainty. Even medical specialists face uncertainty, especially regarding complex co-morbid medical conditions that may hinder applications of existing medical evidences. `(Kim & Lee, 2018)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnostic uncertainty is a subjective perception of inability to provide an accurate explanation of the patient's health problem `(Bhise, Rajan, Sittig, Morgan, Chaudhary & Signh, 2017)`. Dealing with uncertainty in diagnostic focuses on shared decision making, establishing a relationship of trust with patients and meticulous evaluation. The problem of employing machine learning to help practitioners solve the problem of heart disease, has a decision making element. This is deciding if a patient is sick (heart disease) or healthy.  Uncertainty is a key ingredient in this problem, where decision making depends on the amount of uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic machine learning will provide opportunities for modeling uncertainty, performing probabilistic inference, combining prior knowledge and empirical evidence and making predictions or decisions in uncertain environments (heart disease diagnose). In this problem uncertainty can be incorporated by using probabilities to express the degree of uncertainty. This will enable machine learning to advise when uncertain or when it does not know, this can be reassuring for patients, as they would be concerned with trusting artificial intelligent systems. The solution to this problem will adopt a probabilistic framework which will aid in representing and manipulating uncertainty about the models and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "More about uncertainty in medical diagnosis: [PubMed: National Library of Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28936618/) and [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127608/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A generative model will be developed for this problem such that:** <br>\n",
    "- `P( θ | data ) ∝ P( data | θ )P(θ)` *whereby:* <br>\n",
    "- `P( data | θ )` will be the likelihood of the response features given the model and predictor features. `P( data | θ )` is the conditional distribution of the response and predictor features given the model. It is data-driven and as the number of sample data increases the likelihood overwhelms the prior distribution <br>\n",
    "- `P(θ)` will be the prior probability of the model parameters. `P(θ)` is the guess of the model parameters over the predictor features based on domain knowledge <br>\n",
    "- `P( θ | data )` will be the posterior of model parameters. `P( θ | data )` is the conditional distribution of the model parameters given the response and predictor features <br>\n",
    "The probabilistic machine learning model will be formulated considering probability distributions and prior before seeing the data instead of just the training data. <br> <br>\n",
