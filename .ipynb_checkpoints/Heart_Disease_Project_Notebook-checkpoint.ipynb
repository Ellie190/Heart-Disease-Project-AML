    "\n",
    "> Heart disease is a collection of diseases and conditions that cause cardiovascular problems. Normally, in this disease, the heart fails to supply a sufficient amount of blood to other parts of the body in order to accomplish their normal functionalities. This is simply heart conditions that include diseased vessels, structural problems and blood clots. Early and on-time diagnosing of this problem is very essential for preventing patients from more damage and saving their lives. \n",
    "There are many different types of heart disease. Some types can be grouped together according to how they affect the structure or function of your heart. `The solution provided will only focus on diagnosing if a patient has heart disease or not using probabilistic machine learning`\n",

In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. `The \"goal\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient`. \n",
